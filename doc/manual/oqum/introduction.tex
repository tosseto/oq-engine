OpenQuake-engine is the seismic hazard and risk calculation software developed by
the \glsdesc{acr:gem}. By following current standards in software
developments like test-driven development and continuous integration, the
\glsdesc{acr:oqe} aims at becoming an open, and community-driven tool for
seismic hazard and risk analysis.

The source code of the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} is available on a public web-based
repository at the following address:

\href{http://github.com/gem/oq-engine}{http://github.com/gem/oq-engine}.


An \gls{acr:oqe} analysis is launched from the command line of a terminal.

A schematic list of the options that can be used for the execution of the
\gls{acr:oqe} can be obtained with the following command:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{shell-session}
user@ubuntu:~\$ oq engine --help
\end{minted}

The result is the following:
