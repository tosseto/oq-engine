\subsection{Retrofitting benefit/cost ratio maps}

Ratio maps from the Retrofitting Benefit/Cost Ratio calculator require loss
exceedance curves, which can be calculated using the Classical Probabilistic Risk
calculator. For this reason, the parameters \Verb+sourceModelTreePath+ and
\Verb+gsimTreePath+ are also included in this NRML schema, so the whole
calculation process can be traced back. The results for each \gls{asset} are
stored as depicted in Listing~\ref{lst:output_bcr_map}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \Verb+interestRate+: this parameter represents the interest rate used
    in the time-value of money calculations

  \item \Verb+assetLifeExpectancy+: this parameter specifies the life expectancy
    (or design life) of the \glspl{asset} considered for the calculations

  \item \Verb+node+: this schema follows the same \Verb+node+ structure already
    presented for the loss maps, however, instead of losses for each
    \gls{asset}, the benefit/cost ratio (\Verb+ratio+), the average annual loss
    considering the original vulnerability (\Verb+aalOrig+) and the average
    annual loss for the retrofitted (\Verb+aalRetr+) configuration of the
    \glspl{asset} are provided.
