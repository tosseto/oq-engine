\subsection{Probabilistic damage distribution}

The Classical Probabilistic Damage calculator provides the expected damage
distribution per asset as a csv file, an example of which is shown in
Table~\ref{output:probabilistic_damage}.

\input{oqum/risk/verbatim/output_probabilistic_damage}

This file lists the expected number of structural units in each damage state
for each \gls{asset}, for the time period specified by the parameter
\Verb+risk_investigation_time+.
