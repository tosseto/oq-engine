We provide below a list of the ground motion prediction equations implemented
in the \gls{acr:hazlib}. All the implemented \gls{acr:gmpe} use moment
magnitude as the reference magnitude. For each GMPE, the \gls{acr:oqe} name, a
short description, and the corresponding reference are given.

\begin{itemize}

\item AbrahamsonSilva2008 \hfill \\ A ground motion prediction equation
developed in the context of the NGA West project \footnote{\href{http://peer.
berkeley.edu/ngawest/}{http://peer.berkeley.edu/ngawest}}. The model is
applicable to magnitudes 5.0-8.5, distances 0-200 km, and spectral periods 0-10
sec (\cite{abrahamson2008}).

\item AkkarBommer2010 \hfill \\ A ground motion prediction equation developed
using mostly data from Europe and the Middle East. The dataset used to derive
these equations contains events with moment magnitude between 5.0 and 7.6 and
distances up to 100 km (\cite{akkar2010}).

\item AkkarCagnan2010 \hfill \\ A ground motion prediction equation for
shallow earthquakes in active tectonic regions developed using data from the
Turkish strong-motion database. Equations are valid for a distance range of
0â€“200 km and are derived for moment magnitudes between 5.0 and 7.6
(\cite{akkar2010a}).

\item BooreAtkinson2008 \hfill \\ A ground motion prediction equation for
shallow earthquakes in active tectonic regions developed in the context of the
NGA West project. The model is applicable to magnitude in the range 5.0-8.0,
distances $<$ 200 km, and spectral periods 0-10 (\cite{boore2008}).

\item CauzziFaccioli2008 \hfill \\ A ground motion prediction equation derived
from global data base of shallow crustal earthquakes (vast majority coming
from Japan) with magnitudes in range 5-7.2 and distances $<$ 150.0

shallow earthquakes in active tectonic regions developed in the context of the
NGA West \footnote{

The model is supposed to be applicable for magnitude in range 4.0-8.5 (if
strike-slip), 4.0-8.0 (if normal or reverse) and distances 0-200 km.

\item FaccioliEtAl2010 \hfill \\ Based on the same functional form of
\cite{cauzzi2008} but using closest distance to the rupture instead of
hypocentral distance (\cite{faccioli2010})

strong motion data from California and applicable for magnitude in range 4.0-8.0

known ground motion prediction equations for subduction earthquakes. Published
in 1997, is still currently used for the calculation of the ground motion in
subduction tectonic environments. This GMPE covers events of moment magnitude
greater than 5.0 occurred at a distance between 5 and 500 km. The source-site
distance metric is the \gls{acr:rrup}. (\cite{youngs1997})
