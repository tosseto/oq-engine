The source model consist of one source (area). 100 stochastic event sets  are
generated (\texttt{ses\_\-per\_\-logic\_\-tree\_\-path = 100}) (an example
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ses}). Ground motion fields are computed
(\texttt{ground\_\-motion\_\-fields = true}, Figure~\ref{fig:gmfs}) and also
hazard curves from ground motion fields are extracted
(\texttt{hazard\_\-curves\_\-from\_\-gmfs = true}). The corresponding hazard
maps for 0.1 probability are also calculated (\texttt{hazard\_\-maps = true})

\caption{A stochastic event set generated with the event based PSHA demo. 
    The area source defines a nodal plane distribution which distributes 
    events among vertical and dipping (50 degrees) faults with equal weights. 
    Vertical ruptures are then distributed equally in the range 0-180 degrees 
    while the dipping ones in the range 0-360, both with a step of 45 degrees.}
