The hazard component of the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} can compute seismic hazard using
various approaches. Three types of analysis are currently supported:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textit{Classical Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA)},
	allowing calculation of hazard curves and hazard maps following the
	classical integration procedure (\cite{cornell1968}, \citet{mcguire1976})
	as formulated by \cite{field2003}.

	\item \textit{Event-Based Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis},
	allowing calculation of ground-motion fields from stochastic event sets.
	Traditional results - such as hazard curves - can be obtained by post-
	processing the set of computed ground-motion fields.

	\item \textit{\gls{acr:ssha}}, allowing the calculation of ground
	motion fields from a single earthquake rupture scenario taking into
	account ground-motion aleatory variability.

\end{itemize}

Each workflow has a modular structure, so that intermediate results can be
exported and analyzed. Each calculator can be extended independently of the
others so that additional calculation options and methodologies can be easily
introduced, without affecting the overall calculation workflow.
