The configuration file is the primary file controlling both the definition of
the input model as well as parameters governing the calculation. We illustrate
in the following different examples of the configuration file addressing
different typologies of seismic hazard calculation.


\subsection[Classical PSHA]{Classical PSHA}
\label{subsec:config_classical_psha}
\input{oqum/hazard/01d_config_classical.tex}

\subsection{Seismic hazard disaggregation}
\label{subsec:config_hazard_disaggregation}
\input{oqum/hazard/01d_config_disaggregation.tex}

\subsection{Event based PSHA}
\input{oqum/hazard/01d_config_event_based.tex}
\label{subsec:config_event_based_psha}
