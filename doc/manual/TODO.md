Hazard
------

* Check if the output file examples are outdated
* Describe the priority order amongst sites/sites_csv, site_model_file,
  exposure_file, and region, for the set of sites
  where the hazard outputs will be computed
* Describe the (correct?) expected behavior of the stochastic event set
  generator for different values of the three parameters:
  `ses_per_logic_tree_path`, `investigation_time`, `number_of_logic_tree_samples`
  after the changes in the seeding algorithm


Risk
----

* Describe the parameter `time_event` for scenarios
