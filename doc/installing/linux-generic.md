# Installing the OpenQuake Engine on a generic Linux distribution

The OpenQuake Engine is also available in the form of **self-installable binary distribution**.
This way of installing OpenQuake is strongly suggested for old versions of Linux which
do not ship with Python 2.7 (like RHEL/CentOS/SL 6), or for users that do not have
administrator privileges (they cannot run `sudo` or `su`).

### Differences with packages for Ubuntu and RedHat

This distribution has some differences with the packages we provide for Ubuntu and RedHat:

- includes its own distribution of the dependencies needed by the OpenQuake Engine
    - OpenSSL 1.0
    - HDF5 1.8
    - Python 2.7
    - Python dependencies (pip, numpy, scipy, h5py, django, shapely, rtree and few more)
- can be installed without `root` permission (i.e. in the user home)
- multiple versions can be installed alongside
- currently does not support Celery (support for Celery is planned) and clusters setup
- the OpenQuake Engine and its dependencies will not be available to system's python

## Requirements

Requirements are:

- GNU/Linux with bash
- libc version at least 2.14 (i.e. a distro not older than CentOS 6)
- 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 1.2 GB of free disk space

## Install packages from the OpenQuake website
