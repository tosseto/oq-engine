# Installing the OpenQuake Engine on macOS

The OpenQuake Engine is available for macOS in the form of **self-installable binary distribution**.

- this distribution uses Python officially provided by Apple Python and includes its own distribution of the dependencies needed by the OpenQuake Engine
    - pip, numpy, scipy, h5py, django, shapely, and few more
- can be installed without `root` permission (i.e. in the user home)
- multiple versions can be installed alongside
- currently does not support Celery (and will never do)

## Requirements

Requirements are:

- Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), macOS 10.12 (Sierra)
- 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 1.2 GB of free disk space
